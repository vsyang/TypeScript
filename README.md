# Overview

This is my TypeScript project where I created a simple drawing app with HTML5 and Canvas. 

The purpose of writing this software is to learn and familiarize myself with TypeScript which is a more advanced version of JavaScript.

# Development Environment

To create this software, I used Visual Studio Code, and saved into my TypeScript GitHub repository. 

I installed the TypeScript extension and compiled the ts file into a JavaScript file. 

Testing was done on the live server before uploading to GitHub.

# Future Work

In the future, I would like to improve:

- Loading the drawings correctly
- Have the option menu and text bar pop up when user clicks the buttons
- The style (css) portion. There was not enough time this week.
- The bug that occasionally occurs when actually drawing. Sometimes, clicking on the mouse causes a starburst of lines instead of the line the user is drawing.
- Adding an undo/redo feature in case the eraser takes too long
